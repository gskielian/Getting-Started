Hardware

### Does it interact with the Physical World?
If your device or quest interacts with the real world (e.g. a robot or a sensor) then odds are you will need some special device.

Fortunately, there are really inexpensive ones out there -- the most famous one being the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

You can download Arduino Software for free here: [link](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

And last I checked, you can purchase Arduino's nowadays for around $12 from Amazon.com: [link](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=a9_sc_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aarduino&keywords=arduino&ie=UTF8&qid=1382505613)

The cost and versatility of this board make it pretty much a first pick for any project -- except those which you will need to add wireless-networking to.

### Wireless-networking

If you would like to make a web-based project, then at the moment the best options (IMHO) would be either the Raspberry Pi or the BeagleBone Black.

#### Raspberry Pi

If you choose the Raspberry Pi and your project needs to use servos or read analog signals, then you will need to tack on an Arduino to the Pi (which can easily be done).


#### Beaglebone Black

This is often regarded as a more advanced but more powerful platform.  It is like an Arduino + a Raspberry Pi (or so many people say that is what it is), and it can have Linux distros installed on it as well.

It also does analog inputs, and can control servo motors, so if only someone could link me to a good blog or youtube video, then I bet I'll be using mostly this for my projects.
