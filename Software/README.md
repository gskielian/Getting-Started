Software
========



Nowadays I give 3 possible answers to this question (used to be only one: Python), but now I see the virtues in other methods of introducing oneself to the world of code.



### Like Robots?


If you do then I would suggest the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc).  This is a device which will teach you how to actually control robots and automate devices you use daily.

While the software for programming it is free, the device itself is also pretty inexpensive.

Check it out on Amazon (it will save you lots of money)


### Really want to learn to program?

I'd suggest learning Python.  This is a very popular language which is quickly becoming the goto language for fast prototyping.  It also has a host of resources (including https://codecademy.com) which are really good online training resources.


### Specifically want to make a website?

Javascript is sooo popular, that this (plus html and css) will probably be the best pick for ya.  Once you master the basics of javascript, you will not only have the fundamentals of programming down, but you will also have the ability to utilize the oceans of open-code here at github. :octocat:
